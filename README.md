# SmartLoanRecoveryAnalysis

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The Smart Loan Recovery System leverages Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Visualization to identify borrower risk levels and suggest dynamic recovery strategies. By analyzing historical loan data, payment behavior, and financial attributes, this project provides actionable insights for banks and financial institutions to improve loan recovery rates while reducing operational costs.
The system combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering for segmentation, and predictive modeling to create a smart loan recovery framework.
Loan defaults pose a significant challenge for financial institutions by affecting profitability and cash flow. Using historical loan repayment data, borrower profiles, and payment behaviours, many financial companies now use a smart loan recovery system to optimize collection efforts, minimize recovery costs, and maximize loan repayments.
