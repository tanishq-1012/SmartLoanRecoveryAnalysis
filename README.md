# SmartLoanRecoveryAnalysis

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The Smart Loan Recovery System leverages Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Visualization to identify borrower risk levels and suggest dynamic recovery strategies. By analyzing historical loan data, payment behavior, and financial attributes, this project provides actionable insights for banks and financial institutions to improve loan recovery rates while reducing operational costs.
The system combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering for segmentation, and predictive modeling to create a smart loan recovery framework.
Loan defaults pose a significant challenge for financial institutions by affecting profitability and cash flow. Using historical loan repayment data, borrower profiles, and payment behaviours, many financial companies now use a smart loan recovery system to optimize collection efforts, minimize recovery costs, and maximize loan repayments.

## ðŸ“‚Smart Loan Recovery System: Dataset Overview

The project uses a loan dataset (loan recovery.csv) with features such as:

* Demographics: Age

* Financial Attributes: Monthly Income, Loan Amount, Loan Tenure, Interest Rate, Collateral Value

* Behavioral Indicators: Payment History, Missed Payments, Days Past Due

* Loan Attributes: Outstanding Loan Amount, Monthly EMI

* Recovery Indicators: Recovery Status, Collection Attempts, Legal Action Taken

To build a loan recovery system with Machine Learning, we will use a dataset containing borrower profiles, loan details, and repayment histories. This dataset includes critical attributes such as:

* Demographic Information: Age, employment type, income level, and number of dependents.
* Loan Details: Loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and collateral value.
* Repayment History: Number of missed payments, days past due, and monthly EMI payments.
* Collection Efforts: Collection methods used, number of recovery attempts, and legal actions taken.
* Loan Recovery Status: Whether the loan was fully recovered, partially recovered, or remains outstanding.

## Analyzing Data Distribution and Relationships

Now, letâ€™s move to analyzing this data in detail. Iâ€™ll first have a look at the distribution of the loan amount and its relationship with the monthly income:

<img width="1161" height="522" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 2 12 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17061755-3e49-4dba-988f-c7aad517d6d0" />

The graph demonstrates a positive relationship between loan amounts and monthly income, indicating that individuals with higher income levels tend to secure larger loans. The density curve at the top shows the distribution of loan amounts, emphasizing that higher loan amounts are more frequent among higher income brackets.

It highlights the proportionality between income and loan size, which shows an income-based approach in loan approvals or customer profiling.

## Analyzing Payment History

Now, letâ€™s have a look at the payment history. Iâ€™ll first analyze how payment history affects loan recovery amount:

<img width="1161" height="522" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 2 12 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c46fa761-52dd-4590-a4d4-ce5246cbee8b" />

Loans with on-time payments are mostly fully recovered. Delayed payments result in a mix of partial and full recoveries, with some written off. Missed payments have a significantly lower recovery rate, with most loans ending up either partially recovered or written off.

Letâ€™s dive into missed payments in detail by analyzing how missed payments affect loan recovery:

<img width="1161" height="522" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 2 12 48 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68469625-443a-4a3e-9a85-292701669150" />

Loans with partial recovery typically have up to 4 missed payments. Fully recovered loans tend to have fewer missed payments, mostly between 0 and 2. Written-off loans show a higher range of missed payments, with several exceeding 6. A higher number of missed payments significantly reduces the likelihood of full recovery and increases the chances of loans being written off.

## Analyzing Loan Recovery Based on Monthly Income

Now, letâ€™s dive deep into the relationship between monthly income and loan amount recovery. Iâ€™ll first analyze how monthly income and loan amount affect the loan recovery:

<img width="1161" height="522" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 2 13 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baa111e9-0990-4e93-9c22-e78ea3cfb38d" />

Higher-income individuals are more likely to fully recover their loans, even for larger amounts. Borrowers in lower income brackets face a higher likelihood of loan write-offs or partial recovery. This trend highlights the impact of income on loan recovery, as higher earnings lead to better repayment outcomes and fewer write-offs, even for substantial loans.

Now, using K-Means clustering, Iâ€™ll create borrower segments based on monthly income and loan amount:
Letâ€™s visualize the segments to understand them in detail:

<img width="1161" height="496" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 2 13 21 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f38a72-b330-4fbc-8a82-5879b88d6314" />

Segment 1 borrowers take on moderate to high loan amounts, indicating financial stability. The Segment 0 clusters around lower income levels and moderate loan sizes, reflecting potential financial strain. Segment 2 borrowers distribute evenly across the graph, representing a balanced but cautious group. Meanwhile, Segment 3 borrowers concentrate in high-loan areas, especially within specific high-income ranges, highlighting their susceptibility to default despite higher incomes.

## Building an Early Detection System for Loan Defaults based on the Risk Scores

Now, we will use our segments to build a classification model to flag the borrowers with high default risk. Once the model finds the borrowers with a high default risk, we will assign a loan recovery strategy based on the level of the risk of the borrower.

Here, we first labelled borrowers as high-risk based on their segment classification. Then, we selected key financial and behavioural features to train a Random Forest Classifier. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, we trained the model to predict the probability of a borrower defaulting. We then applied this model to the test data to generate risk scores and classify borrowers as high-risk or low-risk based on a probability threshold. Finally, we merged these predictions with borrower details to enable data-driven recovery strategies.

Now, we will create a new column for the dynamic recovery strategy based on risk scores:

<img width="1170" height="368" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 2 13 42 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10c0611a-b774-453f-8e89-e17037478cb6" />

Here, we defined a function that categorizes borrowers into three recovery approaches:

1.immediate legal action for high-risk borrowers (risk score > 0.75),

2.settlement offers and repayment plans for moderate-risk borrowers (0.50 â€“ 0.75),
and automated reminders for low-risk borrowers (<0.50).

3.This function was applied to the test dataset to assign a personalized recovery strategy to each borrower to ensure cost-effective and targeted loan recovery efforts.

So, this is how you can build a smart loan recovery system with Machine Learning.
